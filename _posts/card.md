Cards elevate primary content off of the background. Cards have a degree of elevation that defaults to 1x. If overlaying another card on top of cards with an elevation of 1x, use a card with a 2x elevation. 1.5x Cards should no longer be used going forward. This is a legacy style used for hover states on clickable cards.
