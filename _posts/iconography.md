Use FontAwesome Solid for all icons.

### Accessibility considerations
- Icons without adjacent text require a title attribute to explain their purpose in contrast with vanity icons that repeat or clarify the meaning of adjacent text.
- Icons should not be smaller than 10px.
- If inlining the SVG, add role="img" so screen readers don't skip over it.
- Icon tooltips should have a title as the first item of the SVG which should become.
