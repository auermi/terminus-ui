Text is the main way that users visualize content and complete their work, so we've developed a typographic landscape that uses one font for all standard typefaces in Terminus products. This ensures that the UI is optimized to be highly legible, performs well, and is frictionless as you move between Terminus products and the rest of the system.

### Specific Guidelines
There isn't too much structure around type in the design system yet. However, two important guidelines to keep in mind are the styles for page titles and card titles.

#### Page Titles
Page titles are Roboto Bold at 28pt.

#### Card Titles
Card titles are Roboto Bold at 20pt.

### Other guidelines
Attention to line height is very important. As a general rule, use 1.25 for header type and 1.4 for body type.

### Font Stacks
We use sans-serif fonts for most of our type. The only exception is for when you want to display code in which case you should use monospace fonts. Serif fonts are not used in Terminus products. All sans-serif fonts default to Roboto, and then fall back to the system fonts. All mono fonts default to system monospace fonts.

#### Sans-serif
<code>font-family: 'Roboto', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', 'Ubuntu', 'Droid Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;</code>

#### Monospace
<code>font-family: 'SF Mono', 'Segoe UI Mono', 'Roboto Mono', 'Ubuntu Mono', Menlo, monospace;</code>
